# ENET'App is a 4 in 1 cross-platform application made for ENET'Com
1- School management system

2- School intranet

3- Social network

4- Classroom space

I used Spring Boot framework with Java in the Backend, MySQL as a DBMS, and Flutter framework with Dart in frontend with MVC structure, using GetX as state manager.

## This application can be used by 3 different types of users:
- Admin: can manage school data, application data, and announce the news.
- Professor: Publish courses and exercises to do in the classroom space, can also publish posts and see profiles and posts in the feed, and can use the different services offered by the application as intranet like timetables, exams date, absences...
- Student: See courses and exercises to do in the classroom space, can also publish posts and see profiles and posts in the feed, and can use the different services offered by the application as intranet like timetables, exams date, absences...
